**Request your own data**: The current process to gain access to Cook County Circuit Court data requires a three-step process.

[Pop-up box] 

[1. File a request through snail mail with the Office of the Chief Judge of Circuit Court of Cook County, Judge Timothy Evans.  This request should detail the data you are seeking to access.]

[Send requests to:

Office of the Chief Judge  
Circuit Court of Cook County  
50 West Washington Street, Room 2600  
Richard J. Daley Center  
Chicago, IL 60602 ] 

[2. Upon the Chief Judge’s approval of your request it is sent the Clerk of the Circuit Court to be fulfilled.  The Clerk’s Office maintains the data for the Courts.]

[3. Often the Clerk’s office will require a fee both for programming time and for computer time to extract the data from their systems to fulfill your request.]
