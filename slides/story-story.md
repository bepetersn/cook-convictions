## The Story Behind the Story

This data is public information, but it didn't come easily. It took the Chicago Justice Project over two years to obtain the data used in this project.

What we asked for: all the data involved in all the cases that entered the court for a five-year period, whether or not the case ended in a conviction, including categories such as race.    

[Small interactive timeline w/ pop-out boxes when you scroll over the marker?]
Letter to Judge Evans requesting access to court data in bulk ->   
[two months pass] ->  
CJP receives response to the letter - several months of work to create language   suitable for a request ->  
Judge Evans approve request and it is forwarded to the Circuit Court ->  
constant following up on the request ->  
at six month point, call once a month ->  
one year in, steps toward filing suit ->  
14-month mark, give an ultimatum ->  
data arrives!  

What we got: Only data that resulted in a conviction. No 'race' category. [Need additional details from Tracy/Geoff/Brian on what is missing.]
