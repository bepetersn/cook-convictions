## General info 

This section still needs to be written, but we should plan to use it to hold basic data, such as: 

- percentage of men/women in the system
- how many records are we looking at? 
- how many convictions are drug-related vs violent vs non-violent

Caveat: if we don't have enough general info to fill this, it can be meshed with another area
