## Need to Know

We did this project because we want you -- the Chicago resident waiting for the train, the suburban commuter, the policymaker, the harried journalist -- to know what occurs in courtrooms in Cook County every day.

This data is conviction data, showing every conviction, felony and misdemeanor that occurred in Cook County Criminal Courts from January 2005 to December 2009. We also received the home address, to the hundredth block, of the person being convicted, the date of their arrest and the type of charge.

On this website, we've broken down the data into some of the most important things we've learned. But as you're reading, keep in mind a few things.

- We didn't get race, XX and XX in the data

- We also don't know how many cases are filed, meaning that the actual number of people streaming through the court rooms could be even larger than the thousands of records we were given.

- The total number of cases that were dropped long before they reached a verdict or plea bargain, or where in the process those cases left the system

- We're in the dark about how many cases filed by police actually resulted in a conviction

- We don't know whether the prior convictions of an individual affected the sentence they were given 

- This information doesn't tell us where a crime occurred, prevalence of crime in a particular community, or the total number of crimes that occur in the city. [Pop-out box opportunity? Read more: There are significant differences between the amount of crime that occurs, that is reported to police, that results in arrest, is accepted for prosecution, that is prosecuted, and the amount that ends up in a conviction. At each stage a certain amount of crimes fall out of the system.]

- Some of these cases may have occurred before the conviction was recorded, meaning this data reflects events that could be from years before the conviction was recorded.

While we provide our raw data, the team has modified the data in order to remove any personally identifiable information including exact address of those convicted, fingerprint file..(and so on)

What makes this project unique is our use of bulk data. On your own, you can go to the courtroom and pull any case.

But to really understand the system, we need to take a step back and look at it as a whole. We'll walk you into the previously closed doors of the Cook County Circuit Court. At the end, you'll have the chance to download the data on your own.
