## How a case becomes a case

<div id="c2c-placeholder"></div>

For this project, we are only looking at one part of the criminal justice system - convictions. But before the court convicts an individual, they must come in conflict with the law, be charged, and usually appear in front of a judge. 

Here are a few things to remember about the criminal court system:

- A lot of cases leave the system before they reach a verdict, either through a plea bargain or other deal. 

- Many cases filed by police don't result in a conviction.

- It can take years for a case to move through the system, from when a police report is filed and throught to a conviction or not.
