## Youth Violence	

Crime skews young. There are several reasons for this, from the penchant for misdeeds at a young age to XX XX XX. Cook County hands down XXX more convictions to young people between the ages of 18-24 than it does to all other age groups combined (example of analysis bit). 

### Total convictions by age

<div class="chart" id="convictions-by-age-chart"></div>

The crimes committed by people of different ages also vary. (Note re which one is the most common type of crime among young people, and why) 

Caveat: This is different to the total number of convictions, since we are picking specific groupings.

Even among young people, 18 year olds are the most likely to committ crimes, with 94-year-olds seemingly the least likely.

On the fourth slide, we want to look more closely at the 18-24 age bracket, since the focus of this slide is the extent to which crime skews young. We haven't yet decided what we will analyze, but some suggestions include differences in conviction by sex, the high rates of youth homicide, youth with convictions who live in high-poverty
community areas, and drug crime vs. other offenses.
