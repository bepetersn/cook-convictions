## Offense disparities

<blockquote> When an individual is arrested on a drug charge, they can be booked for manufacturing and deliver, or for possession. Whether it is one or the other depends on many factors - the patrolling officer, whether a person has any priors, or even whether they're able to make a deal with the prosecutor. The majority of drug-related convictions in Cook County are for possession.  </blockquote>

<blockquote> Marijuana, and how it's used in the criminal justice system, has long been a contested issue. Chicago recently gave police officers leeway to use their own discretion in arresting an individual for a marijuana charge rather than fining them. Despite this, investigative reports and our data has shown that criminal convictions for marijuana possession continue to be high.   </blockquote>

<blockquote> Convictions can vary by amounts. A charge for 100 grams of cocaine can hold a starkly difference sentence to that for 5 grams. Most of the manufacture and delivery charges skew towards smaller amounts - in part because people are more likely to carry smaller amounts, but also because plea deals will often leave individuals with convictions for smaller amounts of hard drugs. </blockquote>
