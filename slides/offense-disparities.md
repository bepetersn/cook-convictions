## Among drug crimes, a world of disparities

Though there are offense diparities in many areas, we decided to focus on one of the most controversial - drug convictions. From disparities in crack cocaine to low-level marijuana arrests, looking at the data about drug disparities has been an important source for understanding the criminal justice system. 

 When an individual is arrested on a drug charge, they can be booked for manufacturing and deliver, or for possession. Whether it is one or the other depends on many factors - the patrolling officer, whether a person has any priors, or even whether they're able to make a deal with the prosecutor.

Marijuana, and how it's used in the criminal justice system, has long been a contested issue. Chicago recently gave police officers leeway to use their own discretion in arresting an individual for a marijuana charge rather than fining them. 

In this graphic, we divided marijuana possession charges by their class. The majority of possession charges where class XXX, meaning the majority of people are convicted under the (harshest/not harshest) classs.

Convictions can vary by amounts, but what really matters is the class of a felony or misdemeanor. Many things can impact the class of a conviction - from how the product is packaged to what an individual said during an arrest.
