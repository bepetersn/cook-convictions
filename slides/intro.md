## Into Cook County {needs to be replaced by Brian's title}

Each year, tens of thousands of people stand in front of judges at the Cook County Circuit Court, one of the busiest in the country. Their offenses range from low-level marijuana charges to multiple murders that put people behind bars for life.

Rare glimpses of what happened behind the courtroom doors trickle out through media reports and the few sensational cases that make headlines. 

But getting any more information is difficult. According to the 8 Principles of Open Data, a measure developed by open government advocates to create a set of universal data principles, Cook County courts only meets half of the requirements. 

Instead, a Cook County resident looking for data about the courts meets a months-long request process that moves through multiple government agencies, and with the possibility of a large filing fee. 

**Until now.**

This project analyzes five years worth of conviction data received through the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County by the Chicago Justice Project. The goal is to shed a light on criminal convictions in Cook County.
